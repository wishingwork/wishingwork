### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm John.  I believe weather affects our daily life, so I am dedicated to finding how weather information can apply to our businesses.  [My wordpress blog](https://wishingwork.wordpress.com/) dicusses about the weather applications.  I also like to write gidgets to make automatic systems.  It's fun to put different things together into a creative tool.
