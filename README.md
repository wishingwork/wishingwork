### Hi there 👋, my name is Pou-Chang(John) Chen
#### I am an E-commerce automation engineer
I believe weather affects our daily life, so I am dedicated to finding how weather information can apply to our businesses.🌦️ My wordpress blog dicusses about the weather applications. I also like to write gidgets to make automatic systems.🧱 It's fun to put different things together into a creative tool.

Skills: JS / React / Node / Python
